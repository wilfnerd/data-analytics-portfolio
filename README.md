# Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores customer purchasing behavior using a synthetic but realistic retail dataset.  
The goal is to identify trends in demographics, spending patterns, product performance, and repeat customer behavior to support data-driven business decisions.

## Objective
- Analyze customer demographics and purchasing patterns
- Understand order value distribution and spending behavior
- Identify high-performing product categories
- Compare repeat vs one-time customer behavior
- Translate findings into actionable business insights

## Dataset
- 1,000 customer transactions
- Synthetic data designed to mimic real-world retail behavior
- Covers approximately two years of purchase history

**Key fields include:**
- Customer demographics (age, gender, region)
- Purchase details (date, category, order value, payment method)
- Repeat customer indicator

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- JupyterLab
- Git & GitHub  
- *(Tableau Public – dashboards to be added)*

## Key Insights
- Customer purchases span a wide adult age range, with concentration among mature customers
- Order values are right-skewed, with most purchases at lower values and a few high-value outliers
- Electronics is the highest revenue-generating product category
- Repeat customers place orders of similar value to one-time customers, indicating customer value is driven by purchase frequency rather than order size

## Repository Structure


## Next Steps
- Build interactive dashboards in Tableau Public
- Link Tableau dashboards to this repository
- Expand analysis into SQL-based projects and predictive modeling
